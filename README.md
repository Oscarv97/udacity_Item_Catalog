# Udacity Project 4 Item Catalog

This is the fourth project as part of the Udacity Full Stack web developer nanoDegree
I went a little of course and choose to do my frontend in react with a small bit of react router implementation. Also wanted to try out some of the Firebase Services  

## Getting Started

In the root directory of the project...

1. Install node modules `yarn install` or `npm install` .
2. Install Python dependencies `yarn install-requirements` or `npm run install-requirements` 
3. Initialize the backend Database `yarn setup-database` or `npm run setup-database` 
4. Start development server `yarn start` or `npm run start` .
5. To Test and new changes to the front end on the live data you need to run a new build `npm run build` or restart the server with `npm run start`
    this will push the latest build files to the server/public folder

## Running the tests

Automated unit tests for the front end are done through **Jest** but implementation is not complete `npm run test` 

## Deployment

Deployment Steps will follow in Separate Repository
